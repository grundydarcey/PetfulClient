PETFUL

PETFUL SUMMARIZED -
This website is created to represent an adoption agency that facilitates adoption of dogs and cats online. Instead of a typical adoption agency where adopters pick the pet of their choosing, this projects implements available cats and dogs in a queue data structure. This means, they get either the dog or cat that has been in the adoption agency (queue) the longest. The adopters are also treated the same way. The first person that submits their name for adoption will be the first person to receive a pet. This app starts with a landing page that describes the adoption process and has a button to begin the process. Underneath, there is a display showing the next-up cat and dog to be adopted. The cats and dogs exist in separate queue structures so when a cat is adopted, the display will replace his picture with a picture of the next cat in the queue, but the dog will stay the same. And vice versa. On clicking the start adoption button, the user will be taken to a page to start the adoption process. This will show a form where the user can input their name to be added to the queue. Below the form there is a line of text showing a handful of people in line before the user to adopt. When the user submits their name, they will see their name added into that line. After the name submission, the names previously in the list will be matched up with their pet, and both the names and the pet in question will be removed from the queue and the page view. When the user's name is finally at the front, a button will appear that allows the user to make a choice about whether they'd like a cat or dog. At this point, new names will fall into line at the end of the queue behind the new user's name. Upon pressing the make selection button, the user can choose from a drop-down selector whether they want a cat or dog. After submitting their selection, a button below the selection will allow them to view thier new pet. This prompts a new page, however the queue of people and the display of the next-up dogs and cats stays in view. This next page shows a picture of their new pet along with a description of the new pet.
